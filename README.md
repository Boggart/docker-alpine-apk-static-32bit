[Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/)
============

This is a minimum viable Alpine image: only alpine-keys
and apk-tools-static installed (to allow for verified 
package installing).

The repository cache has been updated (with all mirrors),
so any package can be installed and should be ready to 
run.

You will have to install busybox-static, busybox, 
alpine-baselayout, or alpine-base if you want a shell
[in order of size]).
